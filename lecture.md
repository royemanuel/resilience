Reliability Performance Graph
=============================

1.  Performance graph with performance at 1 and falling to zero at some
    time

    failure to the right

Availability
============

1.  Definition
2.  Equation
3.  Downtime - describe reasons for downtime
    1.  Time to repair
    2.  Logistics delay time
    3.  etc.

Availability Performance Graph
==============================

1.  Performance graph
    1.  Demonstrate methods to improve availability through the
        performance graph. Multiple failure repair cycles
